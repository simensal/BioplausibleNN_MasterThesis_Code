# Backprop Irises

The following repository contains the code for a framework to create neural networks using back propagation, and is meant purely for educational purposes.

The main code for the framework is available in [`ANN.py`](./ANN.py), with necessary helper-functions stored in [`helpers.py`](./helpers.py). A notebook featuring implementation of a model, which is then trained on the iris dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) is available at [`ANN.ipynb`](./ANN.ipynb). Further, an experiment in relation to the specialization project this framework has been implemented is available at [`Experiment.py`](./Experiment.py) where ten agents are trained and tested on the same iris dataset.

Lastly, all necessary 3rd-party libs are available in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) and can be installed using 

```sh
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
