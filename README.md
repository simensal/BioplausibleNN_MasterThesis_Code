# Backprop Irises - Work in progress

The following repository contains the code for an implementation of the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks, and is meant purely for educational purposes. It implements a neural network, and trains it on the iris dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). The dataset is also available in the [`data` -folder](./data) of the repo for simpler running of the notebook. Alongside the data, the notebook itself is [`ANN.ipynb`](ANN.ipynb) and the used thirdparty libs required for running the notebook stored in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
